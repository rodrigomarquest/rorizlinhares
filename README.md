# Clínica Roriz Linhares – No-Show Reduction SPA

[Live Demo](https://rodrigomarquest.github.io/rorizlinhares/) · [Project Board](https://github.com/rodrigomarquest/rorizlinhares/projects/1)

## About

This Single-Page Application (SPA) is the prototype submitted for the **Customer Engagement & AI** module of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence for Business (Technological University Dublin). Its goal is to minimise appointment *no-shows* and early drop-off rates at **Clínica Roriz Linhares** in Goiânia, Brazil, by streamlining booking, automating reminders and maintaining patient engagement between sessions.

## Features

* 📅 **Self-service booking wizard** with real-time slot validation
* 🔔 **Automated multi-channel reminders** (WhatsApp/SMS/e-mail)
* ✏️ **Digital intake & micro-check-ins** (mood scale, quick notes)
* 📊 **Progress tracker** showing attended vs planned sessions
* 🌐 **Responsive UI** (mobile-first, Tailwind CSS)
* 💾 Client-side data persistence via **browser localStorage** (no backend)

## Tech Stack

| Layer  | Tools                    |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| UI     | HTML · Tailwind CSS      |
| Logic  | Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) |
| State  | localStorage + JSON      |
| Deploy | GitHub Pages             |

> Optionally, **Alpine.js** is included for lightweight reactivity—feel free to remove if you prefer pure JS.
